    "abstract": "Traditional methods for evaluating the robustness of large language models\n(LLMs) often rely on standardized benchmarks, which can escalate costs and\nlimit evaluations across varied domains. This paper introduces a novel\nframework designed to autonomously evaluate the robustness of LLMs by\nincorporating refined adversarial prompts and domain-constrained knowledge\nguidelines in the form of knowledge graphs. Our method systematically generates\ndescriptive sentences from domain-constrained knowledge graph triplets to\nformulate adversarial prompts, enhancing the relevance and challenge of the\nevaluation. These prompts, generated by the LLM itself and tailored to evaluate\nits own robustness, undergo a rigorous filtering and refinement process,\nensuring that only those with high textual fluency and semantic fidelity are\nused. This self-evaluation mechanism allows the LLM to evaluate its robustness\nwithout the need for external benchmarks. We assess the effectiveness of our\nframework through extensive testing on both proprietary models like ChatGPT and\nopen-source models such as Llama-3.1, Phi-3, and Mistral. Results confirm that\nour approach not only reduces dependency on conventional data but also provides\na targeted and efficient means of evaluating LLM robustness in constrained\ndomains.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an intuitive method to test the robustness (stability and\nexplainability) of any black-box LLM in real-time via its local deviation from\nharmoniticity, denoted as $\\gamma$. To the best of our knowledge this is the\nfirst completely model-agnostic and unsupervised method of measuring the\nrobustness of any given response from an LLM, based upon the model itself\nconforming to a purely mathematical standard. To show general application and\nimmediacy of results, we measure $\\gamma$ in 10 popular LLMs (ChatGPT,\nClaude-2.1, Claude3.0, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Smaug-72B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-7B,\nMistral-7B and MPT-7B) across thousands of queries in three objective domains:\nWebQA, ProgrammingQA, and TruthfulQA. Across all models and domains tested,\nhuman annotation confirms that $\\gamma \\to 0$ indicates trustworthiness, and\nconversely searching higher values of $\\gamma$ easily exposes examples of\nhallucination, a fact that enables efficient adversarial prompt generation\nthrough stochastic gradient ascent in $\\gamma$. The low-$\\gamma$ leaders among\nthe models in the respective domains are GPT-4o, GPT-4, and Smaug-72B,\nproviding evidence that mid-size open-source models can win out against large\ncommercial models.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, ChatGPT has\nbeen widely used in various applications. The new feature - customization of\nChatGPT models by users to cater to specific needs has opened new frontiers in\nAI utility. However, this study reveals a significant security vulnerability\ninherent in these user-customized GPTs: prompt injection attacks. Through\ncomprehensive testing of over 200 user-designed GPT models via adversarial\nprompts, we demonstrate that these systems are susceptible to prompt\ninjections. Through prompt injection, an adversary can not only extract the\ncustomized system prompts but also access the uploaded files. This paper\nprovides a first-hand analysis of the prompt injection, alongside the\nevaluation of the possible mitigation of such attacks. Our findings underscore\nthe urgent need for robust security frameworks in the design and deployment of\ncustomizable GPT models.

Unfortunately, existing\njailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require\noptimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization\nor efficiency.

    "abstract": "Red-teaming has been a widely adopted way to evaluate the harmfulness of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). It aims to jailbreak a model's safety behavior to\nmake it act as a helpful agent disregarding the harmfulness of the query.\nExisting methods are primarily based on input text-based red-teaming such as\nadversarial prompts, low-resource prompts, or contextualized prompts to\ncondition the model in a way to bypass its safe behavior. Bypassing the\nguardrails uncovers hidden harmful information and biases in the model that are\nleft untreated or newly introduced by its safety training. However,\nprompt-based attacks fail to provide such a diagnosis owing to their low attack\nsuccess rate, and applicability to specific models. In this paper, we present a\nnew perspective on LLM safety research i.e., parametric red-teaming through\nUnalignment. It simply (instruction) tunes the model parameters to break model\nguardrails that are not deeply rooted in the model's behavior. Unalignment\nusing as few as 100 examples can significantly bypass commonly referred to as\nCHATGPT, to the point where it responds with an 88% success rate to harmful\nqueries on two safety benchmark datasets. On open-source models such as\nVICUNA-7B and LLAMA-2-CHAT 7B AND 13B, it shows an attack success rate of more\nthan 91%.

    "abstract": "Because \"out-of-the-box\" large language models are capable of generating a\ngreat deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these\nmodels in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been\nsome success at circumventing these measures -- so-called \"jailbreaks\" against\nLLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle\nin practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method\nthat causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors.\nSpecifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range\nof queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the\nprobability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than\nrefusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our\napproach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of\ngreedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past\nautomatic prompt generation methods.\n  Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach\nare quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs.\nSpecifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e.,\nqueries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as\nmultiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting\nattack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces\nto ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat,\nPythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the\nstate-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models,\nraising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from\nproducing objectionable information.

    "abstract": "An important aspect in developing language models that interact with humans\nis aligning their behavior to be useful and unharmful for their human users.\nThis is usually achieved by tuning the model in a way that enhances desired\nbehaviors and inhibits undesired ones, a process referred to as alignment. In\nthis paper, we propose a theoretical approach called Behavior Expectation\nBounds (BEB) which allows us to formally investigate several inherent\ncharacteristics and limitations of alignment in large language models.\nImportantly, we prove that within the limits of this framework, for any\nbehavior that has a finite probability of being exhibited by the model, there\nexist prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this behavior, with\nprobability that increases with the length of the prompt. This implies that any\nalignment process that attenuates an undesired behavior but does not remove it\naltogether, is not safe against adversarial prompting attacks. Furthermore, our\nframework hints at the mechanism by which leading alignment approaches such as\nreinforcement learning from human feedback make the LLM prone to being prompted\ninto the undesired behaviors. This theoretical result is being experimentally\ndemonstrated in large scale by the so called contemporary \"chatGPT jailbreaks\",\nwhere adversarial users trick the LLM into breaking its alignment guardrails by\ntriggering it into acting as a malicious persona. Our results expose\nfundamental limitations in alignment of LLMs and bring to the forefront the\nneed to devise reliable mechanisms for ensuring AI safety.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) Agents are an emerging computing paradigm that\nblends generative machine learning with tools such as code interpreters, web\nbrowsing, email, and more generally, external resources. These agent-based\nsystems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the\nsecurity foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of\nautomatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the\nconfidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We\nshow how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically\ngiven the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to\nproduction-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration\nattack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out\npersonally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown\ncommand that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack\nshows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range\nof experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they\nreliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM,\nand Meta's Llama. These attacks are multimodal, and we show variants in the\ntext-only and image domains.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of large vision language models (LVLMs), jailbreak attacks serve\nas a red-teaming approach to bypass guardrails and uncover safety implications.\nExisting jailbreaks predominantly focus on the visual modality, perturbing\nsolely visual inputs in the prompt for attacks. However, they fall short when\nconfronted with aligned models that fuse visual and textual features\nsimultaneously for generation. To address this limitation, this paper\nintroduces the Bi-Modal Adversarial Prompt Attack (BAP), which executes\njailbreaks by optimizing textual and visual prompts cohesively. Initially, we\nadversarially embed universally harmful perturbations in an image, guided by a\nfew-shot query-agnostic corpus (e.g., affirmative prefixes and negative\ninhibitions). This process ensures that image prompt LVLMs to respond\npositively to any harmful queries. Subsequently, leveraging the adversarial\nimage, we optimize textual prompts with specific harmful intent. In particular,\nwe utilize a large language model to analyze jailbreak failures and employ\nchain-of-thought reasoning to refine textual prompts through a\nfeedback-iteration manner. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we\nconducted extensive evaluations on various datasets and LVLMs, demonstrating\nthat our method significantly outperforms other methods by large margins\n(+29.03% in attack success rate on average).

    "abstract": "Different from traditional task-specific vision models, recent large VLMs can\nreadily adapt to different vision tasks by simply using different textual\ninstructions, i.e., prompts. However, a well-known concern about traditional\ntask-specific vision models is that they can be misled by imperceptible\nadversarial perturbations. Furthermore, the concern is exacerbated by the\nphenomenon that the same adversarial perturbations can fool different\ntask-specific models. Given that VLMs rely on prompts to adapt to different\ntasks, an intriguing question emerges: Can a single adversarial image mislead\nall predictions of VLMs when a thousand different prompts are given? This\nquestion essentially introduces a novel perspective on adversarial\ntransferability: cross-prompt adversarial transferability. In this work, we\npropose the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA). This proposed method updates the\nvisual adversarial perturbation with learnable prompts, which are designed to\ncounteract the misleading effects of the adversarial image. By doing this,\nCroPA significantly improves the transferability of adversarial examples across\nprompts. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong cross-prompt\nadversarial transferability of CroPA with prevalent VLMs including Flamingo,\nBLIP-2, and InstructBLIP in various different tasks.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as pivotal tools in\nvarious applications. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial\nprompt attacks, where attackers can carefully curate input strings that mislead\nLLMs into generating incorrect or undesired outputs. Previous work has revealed\nthat with relatively simple yet effective attacks based on discrete\noptimization, it is possible to generate adversarial prompts that bypass\nmoderation and alignment of the models. This vulnerability to adversarial\nprompts underscores a significant concern regarding the robustness and\nreliability of LLMs. Our work aims to address this concern by introducing a\nnovel approach to detecting adversarial prompts at a token level, leveraging\nthe LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the\ndegree of the model's perplexity, where tokens predicted with high probability\nare considered normal, and those exhibiting high perplexity are flagged as\nadversarial. Additionaly, our method also integrates context understanding by\nincorporating neighboring token information to encourage the detection of\ncontiguous adversarial prompt sequences. To this end, we design two algorithms\nfor adversarial prompt detection: one based on optimization techniques and\nanother on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM). Both methods are equipped with\nefficient solving methods, ensuring efficient adversarial prompt detection. Our\ntoken-level detection result can be visualized as heatmap overlays on the text\nsequence, allowing for a clearer and more intuitive representation of which\npart of the text may contain adversarial prompts.",

Unfortunately, existing\njailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require\noptimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization\nor efficiency.

To mitigate\nthese safety and informational issues, we propose an attack-and-defense\nframework for studying the task of deleting sensitive information directly from\nmodel weights. We study direct edits to model weights because (1) this approach\nshould guarantee that particular deleted information is never extracted by\nfuture prompt attacks, and (2) it should protect against whitebox attacks,\nwhich is necessary for making claims about safety/privacy in a setting where\npublicly available model weights could be used to elicit sensitive information.\nOur threat model assumes that an attack succeeds if the answer to a sensitive\nquestion is located among a set of B generated candidates, based on scenarios\nwhere the information would be insecure if the answer is among B candidates.\nExperimentally, we show that even state-of-the-art model editing methods such\nas ROME struggle to truly delete factual information from models like GPT-J, as\nour whitebox and blackbox attacks can recover \"deleted\" information from an\nedited model 38% of the time.

In\nthis paper, we propose a theoretical approach called Behavior Expectation\nBounds (BEB) which allows us to formally investigate several inherent\ncharacteristics and limitations of alignment in large language models.\nImportantly, we prove that within the limits of this framework, for any\nbehavior that has a finite probability of being exhibited by the model, there\nexist prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this behavior, with\nprobability that increases with the length of the prompt.
