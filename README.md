# AI Jailbreak Detection Agent - Data Collection Module

A data collection system that autonomously scrapes and processes LLM jailbreak attempts from various sources to support model security training.

## Project Overview

This module handles the data collection pipeline for jailbreak detection:
- Web scraping from GitHub repositories
- ArXiv paper collection
- Data consolidation and preprocessing

## Project Structure

TODO:

  - [ ] Frontend: a (simple) web interface with a UI to show the agent's progress
  - [ ] Quick web server to handle communication between backend and frontend
  - [ ] Project presentation (slides, etc.)
  - [ ] Fill out the form to submit the project (IMPORTANT)
  - [ ] Possibly divide the work among different agents (one handles requests to the target's API, another handles research and prompt crafting)
  - [ ] Test on different models (it probably won't work on normal commercial ones, but worth a try)
  - [ ] Find a target agent to test the system on
  - [ ] Paper search: get text of pdfs, etc.
